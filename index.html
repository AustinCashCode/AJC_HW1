<h3>What is your most complex web-dev project?</h3>
<p>I'm <i>almost</i> totally new to web development, which is why I thought it was a good idea to join the most recent BeaverHacks hackathon! </p>
<p>
    I ended up working on a react-native project with some of my classmates from CS 361. 
    I contributed very little to this project, but I learned a lot about what web development looks like in a more advanced environment,
     so it was a great experience overall. 
    The project we worked on was called FitGood, which was a cross-platform automated wardrobe that would generate "fits" (outfits) that could
    be saved. These saved outfits would then be presented as a daily fit, thus automating the process of picking clothes each day.
    My team mates were <b>Tom Nyuma</b>, <b>Danny Zahariev</b>, and <b>Alyssa Kittle</b>. Tom and Danny might sound familiar to some of you,
    since they were in this class last term, having co-authored the MovieMatchMaker Hall of Fame project! It really is a small world.
</p>

<h3>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My ultemate goal is to understand the project my team made ad BeaverHacks</p>

<h3>Have you signed up on Campuswire?</h3>
<p>Yes!</p>

<h3>Most interesting experience:</h3>
<p>
    By far the most interesting experience I have had was volunteering at OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital.
     About a year and a half ago, I took a volunteer position in the Hematology/Oncology ward at Doernbecher. Overall,
     the most interesting aspect about it wasn't how interesting the work was, but how boring it was. I spent most of my days
     cleaning and gathering toys for children at the hospital. Sometimes, though, this tedious labor of love would be interrupted.
     Sometimes, one of the kids would want to play games with me, which might sound fun, but the reality of the situation is that
     the person you are playing games with is a young child who has been through unimaginable suffering. The experience was never 
     traumatic persay, but you would wonder every day you walked in if you were going to just clean toys, or if you were going to be
     the last friend that a child would have. 
     </p>
     <p>

    One of my most challenging moments was with a young person we will call "J". J had a neurodegenerative disorder that severly impacted
     their ability to engage in daily life. They could not speak, and the only way to know if they liked what you were doing was if
     they looked at you while you were doing it (looking was good). One of J's favorite activities was to play basketball, but, unfortunately,
     J couldn't play due to their disease. So, I was asked to play NBA2K next to J, since they could only experience it vicarously. 
     This continued for a while, when, one day, I was asked to join J as he preped for surgery. I sat down to play, all the while
     nurses and a neurosurgon walk in prepping this young person for surgery. I was asked, <b>by the neurosurgon</b> to contnue playing,
     since it calmed J down. I think it is at this point that I should mention that I'm not very good at 2K. So, there I am, with absolute resolve
     trying my hardest for this young individual to keep it together, all so I can play 2K. It was a sight to behold.
    </p>

    <p>
    J made it through the surgery. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I know this was probably overboard for this question, but the prompt asked me to go with the first thing that came to my head,
     and I would be lying if I said it wasn't this.
