        <h3>Challenges:</h3>
        <p>Overall, this assignment was fairly simple. The biggest challenge I faced was centering the image.</p>

        <h3>What did you learn? What did you already know?</h3>
        <p>I already knew most of the HTML that I was going to use from class, so I focused primarally on the CSS.
             I learned about different CSS syntaxes for styling, and really just practiced.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What resources were most helpful?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Google. If I knew what I wanted, the I would just Google the question, which usually got good results.</li>
            <li>Lecture code. This was good for sanity-checking to make sure I was doing things right.</li>
        </ol>
